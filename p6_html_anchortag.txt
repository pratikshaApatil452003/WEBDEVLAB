                What is LinkedIn?
               LinkedIn is a popular social network with a specific purpose. While other social networks like Facebook and Twitter 
               focus more on your personal life, LinkedIn is all about professional networking—that is, building a group of contacts
               to help advance your career.
               Why use LinkedIn?
               More and more businesses use LinkedIn to screen and recruit potential employees. This is why creating a LinkedIn
               account can make a difference when searching for your next job. Once you've signed up, you can add information to
               your profile page, which is a brief summary of your skills and employment history that effectively serves as an
               online resume.
